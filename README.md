# Parallelized Synchronized Warehousing Robots (PSWR)

## Project Overview

The **Parallelized Synchronized Warehousing Robots (PSWR)** project is an innovative multi-agent robotic system designed for efficient warehouse automation. The system enables multiple autonomous robots to collaboratively retrieve and deliver pallets within a warehouse environment, ensuring smooth operation with synchronized parallel execution and collision avoidance.

Using **computer vision with ArUco markers** and **path planning algorithms**, the robots navigate dynamically changing warehouse layouts, optimizing routes and task assignments without relying on external frameworks like ROS. This project demonstrates an end-to-end solution encompassing localization, navigation, task coordination, and pallet handling.

## Key Features

- **Multi-agent path planning:** Utilizes the A* algorithm and Point & Shoot technique for real-time route planning and dynamic obstacle avoidance.
- **Robot localization:** Employs OpenCVâ€™s ArUco marker detection for accurate positioning and orientation of robots within the warehouse.
- **Centralized command system:** A Python-based control center that assigns tasks, manages robot coordination, and monitors pallet status.
- **Collision avoidance:** Real-time adjustments to robot paths prevent collisions in a shared workspace.
- **Electromagnet gripper control:** Enables autonomous picking and placing of pallets with precision.
- **Parallel execution:** Simultaneous control and task execution of three robots with synchronized movement to maximize throughput.
- **No ROS dependency:** Custom socket communication and control algorithms provide flexibility and ease of integration.
